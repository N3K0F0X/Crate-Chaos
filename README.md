# Crate-Chaos
Note: README taken from private Itch.io preview page.

Crate Chaos is a small game originally made in about a week of time, originally made as a chance to show off what the unity engine is in order for people who know little about video game design, sadly the project never was actually displayed but instead I decided to continue making small tweaks and changes here and there and eventually I do plan to return to work on the project to see it devloped into a more fully fledged game

While Crate Chaos was originally made with a simple idea of showing off the process of making games, I ended up coming back to it after to flesh out more of the games aspects and hope to do so more in the future as it is around thestage of development where only a handfull of the main gameplay elements has been devloped, such as the core sorting mechanic, a couple of interuptions that cause you to be unable to sort crates, the main movement which will most likely see a revamp in the future, and a placeholder main menu. The game has no music nor sound effects, as I was the only developer working on it and hand no time to devote to those aspects but I intend to make or have made some music and sounds to properly help covay the feel of the game. In the end, this is a prototype with little actually inside it and nothing more of a demo of what could happen if I continued to pour time into it, and I hope to do so eventually as I still feel the game is lacking a lot.

Thank you for spending your time reading, and hopefully, playing Crate Chaos. I hope you enjoy your short time with it as much as I enjoyed the short time spent on it.
